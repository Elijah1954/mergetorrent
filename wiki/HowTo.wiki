 # Add all the .torrent files that you want to fix. Also add any files or directories that might have relevant files. Don't worry if you add extra files or directories, mergetorrent will figure it out.
 # *Exit uTorrent.*
 # Press "Start!". The process might take a few minutes depending on how many torrents there are. (Around 1 minute per Gigabyte of data.)
 # Restart uTorrent.
 # *Stop all the torrents that you merged and "Force re-check" on them.*
 # Now you can start the torrents again.
