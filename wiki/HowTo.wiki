How to use mergetorrent

= Details =
 # Add all the .torrent files that you want to fix.
 # Add any files or directories that might have relevant files.  Don't worry if you add extra files or directories, mergetorrent will figure it out.  When you add a directory, all the subdirectories beneath it get added, too.
 # *Exit uTorrent.*  uTorrent gets confused if you merge while uTorrent is running.
 # Press "Start!". The process might take a few minutes depending on how many torrents there are. (Around 1 minute per gigabyte of data.)
 # Restart uTorrent.
 # *Stop all the torrents that you merged and "Force re-check" on them.*  If you don't do this, uTorrent won't notice the progress.  You can only force re-check on stopped torrents.
 # Now you can start the torrents again.
